# Responsive-Shopee-Clone-Website
This is a repo that I use for saving the project from practicing HTML and CSS. The project is also a clone website and I chose the Shopee E-commerce website as the main one.

This is the main source that I used for learning HTML and CSS. Also, I tried to code this project simultaneously as I learned HTML and CSS with Son Dang.
